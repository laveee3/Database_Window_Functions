# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Loyalty Program SQL Analysis  

This project contains solutions to a series of SQL questions related to a restaurant's loyalty program. The dataset includes three tables:  
- **members** ‚Äì information about customers and their membership join dates  
- **sales** ‚Äì purchase history of customers  
- **menu** ‚Äì menu items and their prices  

The objective is to analyze customer spending habits, menu popularity, and loyalty program performance.

## **Questions & Solutions**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**  
**Query:**  
```sql
SELECT m.customer_id, SUM(price) AS total_spent
FROM members m
JOIN sales s ON m.customer_id = s.customer_id
JOIN menu ON s.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY 1;

2Ô∏è‚É£ How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

3Ô∏è‚É£ What was the first item purchased by each customer?
Uses a window function to identify the first purchase

4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased?

Advanced Questions
The later queries explore:
Customers' favorite items
Items purchased before and after joining the loyalty program
Points earned based on spending and bonus rules

Key Concepts Used
Joins (INNER JOIN) to combine tables
Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT)
Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)
CASE statements for conditional logic
CTEs (WITH clauses) for query readability

How to Run
Load the members, sales, and menu tables in any SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
Run each query in sequence to get results for the respective questions.
